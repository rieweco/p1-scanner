FSA Table and Driver

the FSA table is in the scanner.cpp and scanner .h files. 
it is a 2d array using verbose variable names for the states.
there is a map i use to convert the names into values. 

the driver is in the testScanner.cpp and testScanner.h files. 

in the main.cpp I invoke the scan() function that runs the testScanner.
testScanner checks tokens one at a time.
